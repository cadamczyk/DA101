```{r}
data("weather")
```

```{r}
#Find the minimum, mean and maximum temperature


```

```{r}
#Create a new dataset called weather_temp by selecting year, month, day, hour, and temp from weather. Use make_datetime to create a column that includes date and time together called temperature


```


```{r}
#Create a bar graph to show the average temperature per month

```
