```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
```


```{r}
data(airlines)
data(flights)

```


```{r}
#Create a new dataset called flights2 by selecting year, month, day, hour, minute, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier from flights. Also use make_datetime() to make a new variable called departure
flights2 <- flights %>%
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier) %>%
  mutate(departure = make_datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute))
``` 


```{r}
#Join flights2 with airlines by carrier
flights2 %>% 
  left_join(airlines)
```


```{r}
#Plot a bar graph for departure time by day of the week using wday
flights2 %>%
  mutate(wday = wday(departure, label = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=wday)) + 
  geom_bar()
```
