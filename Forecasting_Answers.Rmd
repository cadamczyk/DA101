```


```{r}
#Plot the data
plot(AirPassengers)
```


```{r}
#Plot the components of the time series
data<-ts(AirPassengers, frequency=12)
d<-decompose(data, "multiplicative")
plot(d)
```


```{r}
# h = 10*12 because, forecast is for 10 years for all 12 months
model<-auto.arima(AirPassengers)
summary(model)

f<-forecast(model, level=c(95), h=10*12)
plot(f)
